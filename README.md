# league-of-legends-region-prediction
In this project I to predict region of a champion, based on his story.

I parsed data from League of Legends official website https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_AU/champions/

We used main story, because short story version was not enough for our [Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB.html).

Graphs, results and code are visible [here](https://github.com/StoparPrimoz/league-of-legends-region-prediction/blob/main/League_of_legends_region_prediction.ipynb).
